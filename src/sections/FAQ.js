            <summary><h3>I'm inexperienced as a programmer, can I still participate?</h3></summary>
            <p>Of course! Participating in a Hackathon is a great way to get more experience; you can either join a team of more experienced participants and learn from them, or participate yourself and grow from the challenge, and hopefully even gain an awesome portfolio piece by the end of the Hackathon.</p>
            <p>Remember, it isn't all about winning; BrisHack is a fun event for you to learn and explore new technologies and areas!</p>

            <summary><h3>Do I need to dream up a solution to a huge/very serious problem?</h3></summary>
            <p>You don't need to solve a huge problem; progress comes in small nudges! If you think you've got the cure to world hunger, that's awesome! But don't be put off entering because you are tackling a small issue; oftentimes it's the focussed solutions that are the most effective.</p>
